            <h2>Context About the project</h2>
            <p>My Choose your own adventure story was a Romantic Adventure, where you had three options to pick from, whoever you picked your goal was to try and date them. There are three characters with three orginal storylines too them. It's short and simple but I think it's good.</p>
           <h2>Content in the project</h2>
            <p>In my project, there are two base endings (Getting together or staying friends) and two special endings for two out of the three characters.</p>
            <h2>The Reflection</h2>
            <p>My teacher made this project because he wanted to teach us how to communicate and share a IDE/command line. We chose our partners semester one, and in the second semester me and my partner got split into different periods. This made it difficult because it was harder to communicate, but it helped us get creative with the way we communicated. For example, we would make files to send messages to each other and then delete them later. This system worked well for us. We also communicated using text to see where we were in the project. Some challanges me and my partner had was working with the command line. The IDE sometimes wouldn't pull correctly, leading me and him to not get out work done. In the future, we both have to remember to commit and push before we say that we've done something so there is no confusion.</p>
